# JSON spitter

Have an endpoint that will spits a custom json.

Check out the file `app/myJson.mjs`. There is were you will put a custon json to be spitted through a local api.

To rise the environment, just use the normal Docker command to rise a Docker environment from a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Then access the output (through a Postman or even a browser): http://localhost:3007.
